## Hi there, I'm Mauricio 👋🏼

I'm an Industrial Engineer who found a strong passion in data. I'm currently expanding my expertise in pipeline development, as well as deepening my skills in data analysis and machine learning/predictive models. I'm constantly exploring new ways to turn raw data into valuable insights.

💼 I enjoy working with tools like SQL, Python, Power BI, R, and Google Cloud Platform (BigQuery, Looker Studio, Dataflow, Vertex AI, LookML).  
🌱 Right now, I’m focused on learning more about Dataflow, Airflow, dbt and advanced analytics in the cloud.

Feel free to explore some of my projects, including customer segmentation, sales forecasting, and HR analytics.
